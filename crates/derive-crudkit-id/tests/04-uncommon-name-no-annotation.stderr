error: To derive CrudId, at least one id field must exist.

         = help: A field is an id field if it is (a) named "id" or (b) annotated with `#[crud_id(id)]`, both marking the field as part of the entities id. Specify id fields or remove the derive, if no id fields can be defined for this entity.
